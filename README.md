# Shopify App with Node.js and React

This Shopify App creates discounts, reads product data, writes new price changes when discounts are applied and charges merchant fees with Shopify's Billing API. The functional app runs in the development environment and enables several frameworks, tools, and libraries with webhooks, which listens for relevant events that happen on the development store.
